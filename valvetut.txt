SteamVR Advanced Video Settings & Sliders Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to unlock Valve Index-style per-application video settings sliders inside the VR dashboard without spoofing your headset.

Step 1: Enable Advanced VR Settings in SteamVR
	1.	Open SteamVR on your desktop.
	2.	Click the ☰ Menu (top left) and select Settings.
	3.	Scroll down and enable “Advanced Settings” (if it isn’t already).
	4.	Under the Video section, enable “Per-Application Video Settings.”

Some settings will now appear in VR, but to unlock all the sliders, continue with the steps below.

Step 2: Force All Video Settings to Show in VR
	1.	Open the file:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\steamvr.vrsettings
in a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++.
	2.	Find the “steamvr” section and add or modify the following settings:
{
“steamvr”: {
“showAdvancedSettings”: true,
“enableDashboard”: true,
“showPerfGraph”: true,
“allowCustomResolution”: true,
“supersampleManualOverride”: true,
“maxRecommendedResolution”: 8192
}
}
	3.	Save the file and restart SteamVR.
	4.	Open the SteamVR Dashboard (press the System button while in VR).
	5.	Navigate to Settings > Video and check that all sliders are unlocked.

Step 3: Unlock More Per-App Video Sliders (Including Index-Specific Ones)
	1.	In the same steamvr.vrsettings file, locate the “perAppSettings” section.
	2.	Add or modify the section with the following settings:
“perAppSettings”: {
“default”: {
“allowMotionSmoothing”: true,
“allowInterleavedReprojection”: false,
“motionPrediction”: 0.02,
“motionSmoothing”: true,
“renderTargetMultiplier”: 2.0,
“preferredRefreshRate”: 144
}
}
Note:
	•	This forces motion smoothing, reprojection settings, and refresh rate sliders to appear.
	•	If your headset doesn’t support 144Hz, the refresh rate slider may not function as expected.

Step 4: Final Steps
	1.	Save all changes made to the steamvr.vrsettings file.
	2.	Restart SteamVR.
	3.	Put on your headset, open the SteamVR Dashboard, and navigate to Settings > Video > Per-Application Settings.
	4.	You should now see the extra sliders inside VR!

This tutorial lets you access advanced settings without forcing your VR system to think you’re using a Valve Index.

Enjoy tweaking your VR experience!
